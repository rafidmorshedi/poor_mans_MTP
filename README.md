# Poor Mans MTP
## Background
This project is my experimental attempt at trying to use the accelerometers/roll/pitch and azimuth sensors on my phone to try to analyse ride quality on trains. This repository has the R code used to analyse the data. It is very much a work in progress. 

I am just curious as to how much asset information we can possibly derive from using a smartphone attached to a train window using blue tack.
