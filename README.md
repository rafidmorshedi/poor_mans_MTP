## Background
This project is my experimental attemt at trying to use the accelarometers/roll/pitch and azimuth sensors on my phone to try to analyse rideq quality on train rides.

## Hardware
I stuck my phone on the window to a Sydney Trains Waratah train (A-set) using blue tack and them used the (Physics Toolbox Suit App)[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrystianvieyra.physicstoolboxsuite&hl=en] to record the sensore data from my Oppo A57 phone.
