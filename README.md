# Poor Mans MTP
## Background
This project is my experimental attemt at trying to use the accelarometers/roll/pitch and azimuth sensors on my phone to try to analyse ride quality on train rides. This repository contains the R code used to analyse the data to try and get some meaningful insights from the data. It is very much a work in progress.

## Hardware
I stuck my phone on the window to a Sydney Trains Waratah train (A-set) using blue tack and them used the [Physics Toolbox Suit App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrystianvieyra.physicstoolboxsuite&hl=en) to record the sensore data from my Oppo A57 phone.

## Goals
Idealy the code and associated hardware/methods could be used to do the the following things:
- measure ride quality on varios parts of the railway
- identify areas of track that are in need of maintinince and/or are changing
- genaralise the approach to assess roads as well as train tracks.

Pull request and ideas/feedback are more than welcome.
